For more detailed buid instructions refer to my [blog](https://xeonqq.github.io/design/home-made-self-balance-robot/)

## Demo

The robot can balance itself on two wheels and can handle small disturbance. Further work shall be done on remote controlling to move it.

##Compilation
Use CMake to compile the code

For Arduino Leonardo, I have to use the upload.py for uploading the binary. For other Arduino boards, use "make upload".

## Hardwares
1. [Arduino Leonardo Board](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo)

2. [2 DC Motors: JGA25-371 with encoders](http://world.taobao.com/item/40496339515.htm?fromSite=main&spm=a1z0d.6639537.1997196601.413.U9SqEj)

## Pin Connection
Refer to [motor.h](https://github.com/xeonqq/balance_robot/blob/kalman/motor.h). Leonardo Serial1 is used to connect the Bluetooth.

## Dependency
MPU6050 lib from [i2cdevlib](http://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib.git) and [arduino-pinchangeint](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/downloads/list). You need to place the libs in the ~/sketchbook/libraries/ folder

## Software Key Components
1. *Kalman filter*: to fuse the data from accerometer and gyro and output angle. The implementation is referenced from TKJElectronics's [Balanduino](https://github.com/TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter).

2. *PID control*: "velocity" PID which can prevent integral windup (Further theory refer to this [link](http://lorien.ncl.ac.uk/ming/digicont/digimath/dpid1.htm)). Target is to stablize the robot around angle 0. In this version of software I used a two-level controller to gain better performance.

3. *Tune PID via Bluetooth*: I downloaded [BlueTerm](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.pymasde.blueterm&hl=en) to pair and communicate with arduino. Can Tune the PID without wire.

4. *Motor control*: control use PWM signal. The motor has a minimum PWM to be applied, because under certain minimum PWM value the motor does not move at all.

5. *Python Debug*: python script analysis/serial_plot.py can plot the data from Serial port in real time. But the message has to follow the format *"name\t value\t name\t value\t...\n"*

## Problem encountered
This motor can not supply enough torque when the robot deviate its angle too much, so the robot can still fall down when angle error is big.
